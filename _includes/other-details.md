#### Attendance
Students are expected to attend all class sessions. Instructors establish attendance and participation requirements for each of their courses. Class requirements, regardless of delivery mode, are not waived due to a student's absence from class. Instructors will require students to make up any missed coursework and may deny credit to any student whose absences are excessive. Instructors must keep an attendance record for each student enrolled in the course to document attendance and participation in the class.

#### Recording of Class Sessions
Class sessions for this course may be recorded. Recordings will be available only to the instructor(s) and students enrolled in the class, including those who cannot attend the live sessions. Recordings will be automatically deleted 180 days after their date of creation. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not enrolled in the class, or uploaded to other online environments. Students who are not comfortable with participating in a recorded discussion session should let the instructor know and use an alternate method to engage in class (e.g., use of chat function or remove/change names in the recording). Students in a class are prohibited from recording of any kind unless authorization is obtained from the instructor. 

#### University Email Policies
Students are expected to check their official UVA email addresses on a frequent and consistent basis to remain informed of University communications, as certain communications may be time sensitive. Students who fail to check their email on a regular basis are responsible for any resulting consequences.

#### University of Virginia Honor System
All work should be pledged in the spirit of the Honor System at the University of Virginia. The instructor will indicate which assignments and activities are to be done individually and which permit collaboration. The following pledge should be written out at the end of all quizzes, examinations, individual assignments and papers: “I pledge that I have neither given nor received help on this examination (quiz, assignment, etc.)”. The pledge must be signed by the student. For more information, visit [www.virginia.edu/honor](www.virginia.edu/honor).

#### Accessibility Statement
UVA is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with your instructor. If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you may also want to meet with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC), to request an official accommodation. You can find more information about SDAC, including how to apply online, through their website at [sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu](sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu). If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please make sure to send your accommodation letter to your instructor and meet with them so that you can develop an implementation plan together.
