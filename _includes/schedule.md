**Standalone Libraries**  
* ToneJS: audio in the browser
* three.js: display 3D models in the browser
* p5.js: procedural 2D/3D graphics
* leaflet: work with maps
* D3.js: charts, graphs, histograms, etc

**Built-In Javascript APIs**  
* Web Storage API: access localStorage, which behaves similarly to cookies
* History API: programmatically refresh/back/forward a single tab
* Geolocation API: get user's physical position
* HTML Drag and Drop API: like it says on the can!

#### Assignment

<!-- ------------------------
----------- DAY 8
---------------------------->

### Day 8 (7/15)
Final project day!

#### First Half: Lab
No lab: the first half of class is project presentations within your group. Everyone is expected to give critique or present ideas.

#### Second Half
With the remaining time, we'll briefly discuss each group's experience with the final, and then either continue with exploring various JS libraries, or we'll talk about next steps with front-end development.

#### Assignment
* Your final project is due by tomorrow, 7/16, at 11:59pm. Grades are due on the 18th, so there isn't a ton of wiggle room!
