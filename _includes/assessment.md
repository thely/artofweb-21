## Class Policies, Requirements and Expectations

**Requirements**  
* Attend all eight class sessions. If you absolutely need to miss class, you *must* to contact me to make other arrangements.
* Complete all assignments on time. Each day an assignment is late is 20% off its grade.
* Participate in group activities. Help actively research or brainstorm – don't let one person shoulder the weight of understanding the content.

**Expectations**  
I do not expect everyone in this class to be equally creative and code-savvy.

* On creativity: Sometimes, you can make a working product, but can't come up with new ideas. Let that spur you towards participating more in brainstorming, throw your ideas in the pot (even bad ones!), and see where your group members can help you grow. Creativity is a muscle like everything else.
* On code: Sometimes, your creativity outstrips your ability to implement your ideas. Ask more questions during the lecture part of class, and during group work. Hearing a concept reiterated from more than one person generally helps it stick more. If you're truly stuck, and Google isn't helping, give it 30 minutes, and then email me. Code is a muscle like everything else.

Not every assignment will be to your taste. Put the effort in anyway, and learn as much as you can in the process.

**Communication**  
If you have questions or need to reach out, ask your questions during class over Zoom, or immediately after class if you prefer them to be private. I will respond to email within 24 hours.

**Trigger Warnings**  
Throughout this course, I will be showing you online works from artists and designers as examples. Where appropriate, I will preface these works with a trigger warning. As the browser is generally a solo interaction, you are free to not engage with works that you do not feel safe experiencing. You won't be missing out – for every potentially problematic work, I'll include at least one safer piece.

In your projects, you are welcome to explore darker topics. While I don't have triggers, I would appreciate a warning if your piece contains content that goes beyond a PG-13 rating.
