If you want some practice with `display: grid`, [Grid By Example](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/) is an exhaustive look at everything you can do with the property (it's a *lot*). Or, if you just want to get used to it a little more, [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) is a pretty cute exploration of how CSS grids work.
