            <p>Things we covered today:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="about.html">about.html</a>, which is another page that uses the `link` tag to load an external stylesheet.</li>
                <li><a href="metanarrative.html">metanarrative.html</a>, which is a basic version of the Sequential Metanarrative assignment.</li>
                <li><a href="cascade.html">cascade.html</a> is an example of how later or more specific styles will override previous ones.</li>
                <li>One of the things we covered was how links and relative links work. You may notice that I made a separate folder <em>inside</em> the day3 folder called "images," where I'm putting my images.</li>
