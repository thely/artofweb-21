## Class description 
While social media dominates much of how we interact and create online, a blank web page has immense potential as an artistic medium for anyone with the ability to manipulate it. In this course, you’ll design and build websites from the ground up, learning the technical side of markup and behavior while experimenting with storytelling and design. Projects range from building common website patterns to exploring the purely aesthetic capabilities of the browser. How does a site’s design sell you on a product? How does an online article sell you on an idea? How can text, image, video, and interactivity work together to build a cohesive experience? What art exists out there, emboldened, hindered, or inspired by the unique affordances of the internet? This course is equal parts creativity and code; comfort with either or both is helpful, but not required.

## Course Objectives

* Use the web page as a medium for multimedia and/or interactive storytelling
* Build pages using HTML5, CSS3, and JS
