## Interactive Fiction in Miniature

Tell an extremely short interactive story with the browser. Typically, "interactive fiction" is very similar to a [choose your own adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) game/book, but it doesn't need to be just this. Do things move around when you click them? Do you want to scroll around to different parts of the page? Do you want let the user interact by typing in a text box and hitting Enter? Do you want to tell your story through images or emojis rather than text?

To make this easier on yourself, pick a story idea that can be made very short. Examples:
* You are in a dangerous situation. What happened, and how do you escape?
* You work at a dead-end job. How do your interactions give us a sense of your character?
* You just met the love of your life. How do you have a good first conversation without losing your cool?
* Your phone is dead, and you don't know the city that well. How do you get home?

Where you can, emphasize choice and interaction over tons of text. Use the browser for what the browser does best!

### Brainstorm

We'll brainstorm ideas in your groups. Do you have ideas that use the existing story prompts? Are you inspired by some of the works we looked at in class? Something completely different?

Use of an idea isn't exclusive to one group member – if all of you are inspired by one concept and want to explore it as far as you think it'll go, do it. Don't hold back on ideas, even if you think they're dumb. You don't lose anything by writing it down.

### Requirements

This is an individual project, not a group project. Even though you brainstormed as a group (and you can keep discussing as a group), and though your idea may have some similarities with your group members, make sure your project is yours alone. Your implementation should not be a copy anyone else's work.

**Technical**:  
* Use some amount of state (variables/conditionals). I.e., when I press button A, the first block of text changes.
* Use some amount of user interaction. These can be button presses, clicking non-button parts of the page (images, paragraphs, etc), pressing keys on the keyboard, resizing the window, moving the mouse around, etc.

**Style:**  

It doesn't need to be perfect, but make it look serviceable (post-2004). If you use images, make sure they're sized appropriately. Think about how you can use fonts and colors (and other CSS styles) creatively.

**Reflection:**  

In your README.md, do a quick reflection. What was your story, and what inspired you? What did your group discuss, and what did you wind up doing?
