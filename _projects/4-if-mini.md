## Interactive Fiction in Miniature

Tell an extremely short interactive story with the browser. Typically, "interactive fiction" is very similar to a [choose your own adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) game/book, but it doesn't need to be just this. Do things move around when you click them? Do you want to scroll around to different parts of the page? Do you want let the user interact by typing in a text box and hitting Enter? Do you want to tell your story through images or emojis rather than text?

To make this easier on yourself, pick a story idea that can be made very short. Examples:
* You are in a dangerous situation. What happened, and how do you escape?
* You work at a dead-end job. How do your interactions give us a sense of your character?
* You just met the love of your life. How do you have a good first conversation without losing your cool?
* Your phone is dead, and you don't know the city that well. How do you get home?

Where you can, emphasize choice and interaction over tons of text. Use the browser for what the browser does best!

### Requirements

This is an individual project, not a group project. Even though you brainstormed as a group (and you can keep discussing as a group), and though your idea may have some similarities with your group members, make sure your project is yours alone. Your implementation should not be a copy anyone else's work.

**Technical:**  
* Use at least one array. This can represent the steps in your story, but it doesn't have to.
* Use at least two types of interaction. These can be button presses, clicking non-button parts of the page (images, paragraphs, etc), pressing keys on the keyboard, resizing the window, moving the mouse around, etc.
* The story should have at least one place where it branches – as in, the user's choice should affect which of 2+ options are shown next at at least one point. This doesn't need to have a ripple effect on the rest of your story unless you want it to.
* The story should play out on the page itself, not in the console log. This (likely) means changing the `innerText` of some elements, or applying `display: none` in some cases.

**Style:**  

It doesn't need to be perfect, but make it look serviceable (post-2004). If you use images, make sure they're sized appropriately. Think about how you can use fonts and colors (and other CSS styles) creatively.

**Submission**  

Same Neocities link as before. On Collab, include a short reflection – what did you find difficult? What did you discover? What inspired your story?
