## Final Project

### Content

The content of your final project is very flexible. What you wind up creating is entirely up to you, but it should utilize what you’ve learned in this class. Here are some suggestions:

* A continuation or reimagining of one of the previous projects, as long as you can make significant additions to it. If something you did for one of the in-class experiments inspired you, you can also use that as a jumping-off point. The Geocities project(s) only count if you make them look significantly better.
* A portfolio site for yourself, with links to the works you’ve already done in this class. You’ll need to add some extra pages: an About page for yourself, a Works page for the projects, and at least one other page of your choice. Portfolio sites are a great tool for your future––I recommend you make one, even if you don’t do it for this course. This can’t be done as a group, unless you’re doing a portfolio of your group as a collaborative artistic entity.
* Something completely new, unrelated to any previous projects or assignments you’ve made for this class, but still striking a balance between creativity and code.
* An exploration of one of the standalone libraries we discuss on day 7, with a reasonably well-formatted page surrounding it.

### Group?

You can work with up to two other people on this project. Note that this project does not need to be a team project unless you (and someone else) want to.

In keeping with the mixed nature of the group work in this class, you're also free to make a solo project that is separate but related to someone else's, such as two different responses to the same concept/prompt/dataset.

### Requirements

* Your site represents a reasonable degree of complexity, taking into account your progress from previous projects.
* Your site is expressing a creative idea, which is reasonably well-developed, taking into account the limited amount of time you have to create it.
* If your site is an continuation of a previous project, it has clearly developed and grown since its earlier iteration.

### Submission

Along with the site itself, send me a short reflection (~500 words). What did you choose to do? What were you inspired by? What did you discover in the process, and what did you find challenging?
