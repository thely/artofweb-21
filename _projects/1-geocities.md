## Very Bad 1996 Personal Webpage

Before Squarespace and Wix, there were an array of free webhosts, none of which gave you any guidance as to good web design. Geocities, Lycos, and Angelfire were the most frequent, but there were (I’m sure) others that have since died. Their models were not especially economically sound, but we’ll make some really abysmal web pages in their honor.

### Concept

Invent a character who is ready to create their first webpage on something as rudimentary as Geocities. Who are they? What’s their name? What do they like? How old are they? Why are they making this site? Common themes: fan pages, sharing art, serial stories, tutorials, walkthroughs, small business sites. You can look at [One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age Photo Op](https://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/) to look at a vast array of Geocities landing pages (many of them broken) for inspiration.

Make their landing page. This should include a mix of text (with different fonts, font colors/stylings), images (static and animated), likely some autoplaying background audio, anchor links to parts of the page, and a few embeds from other sites. Go to as many extremes as you want––these pages did not often look very good. Things to think about: do they share their face? Do they have an alias? Are they good at what they do? Do they use emoticons?

### Requirements

**Technical requirements:**

* structural tags: html, head, body, title
* content tags: at least three `p` tags, at least three `img` tags, at least one header tag (`h1`-`h6`), at least one `table`, at least two other tags (`iframe`? `audio`?)
* at least three things included from the Resources section
* at least two pages, linked to each other with `<a>`

**Artistic requirements:**

I don’t need to be fully convinced that this character is a real person (maybe it’s more interesting if they aren’t?), but there should be evidence that you put effort in. There's a lot you could say about the visual style of this era, but one thing that's certain is that it was [*maximal*](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/maximalist-design) (to the point of ugliness). You don't need all your content to be on-brand, you just need to have a *lot* of it.

### Submission

Using the repository we made in class, make a folder for this project, which will contain all your content (HTML files, any images, audio/video, etc).

On Collab, submit the (working) link to the GitHub Pages hosted version of your site, which should look like: `https://cool-username.github.io/repo-name/project1`. I should be able to look at the site itself, *not* your HTML files at something like `https://github.com/cool-username/repo-name/blob/main/project1/index.html`.

Make sure the version on GitHub actually looks the way you expect. Commit and push throughout the process to save yourself the tears!

We'll go through this process in class.
