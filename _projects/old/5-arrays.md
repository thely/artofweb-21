## Arrays.

It's hard to make arrays creative without involving stuff we haven't done yet. Instead, this assignment will mainly be code practice. Each portion of this lab is an equal part of the grade.

#### Exercise 1
Make an array full of numbers from 1-20. Do the following:
* Loop through the array with both `for` and `array.forEach`, and log a message with each array element.
* Log only the even numbers using `filter`.
* Log the total of all the numbers in the array using `reduce`.

#### Exercise 2
Make an array that represents just the text of a conversation between two people, metadata excluded. Anything goes––invented conversation, a text exchange with your friend, a dialogue from a movie, etc. Style these as if they were in a messaging app.

**Extra credit:**
* Add names and user icons, switching depending on index position.
* Use a second array for the send time, and include it alongside every message. (Metadata tells its own story!)

#### Exercise 3
Download at least nine photos from somewhere. They can be from your phone, from someone's Instagram, from Unsplash, etc. Make two arrays, one with the photos, and another with captions for each photo. Display them as a gallery using flexbox.

**Extra credit:**
* Shuffle one of the arrays. What happens to the narrative once it's displayed?
* Figure out how to use nth-child stylings to highlight some of the images, but not others.
