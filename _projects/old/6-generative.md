## Uncreative Writing

This assignment is all about borrowing, stealing, generating, and re-processing.

Find a book from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), and grab the text from its HTML view. Use as much of it as you want.

Transform that text to the point where its meaning is significantly changed. You can do this by merging it with the text of a second chapter, merging it with itself, using libraries to change its tense/meaning/rhyme, replacing some words with images, etc.

### Requirements

* Use at least one library and one API from the resources tab.
* The content of the page should be different every time it loads. (If you want to go the extra mile and make the styles random as well, you're welcome to do that.)
* This assignment is more of a collage than a normal "writing" assignment. You're aiming for something that surprises you, not something that is consistently evocative, emotional, meaningful, etc. Visually, these are often chaotic. Like a visual collage, the more chaotic, the better.

### Resources
* [Corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora): full of large JSON databases in a bunch of different categories
* [RiTaJS](https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS): toolkit for generative writing and natural language processing
* [compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise): more natural language processing
* [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/): random image "generator" API
* [text2img](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text2img): AI random image generator (terrifying)
