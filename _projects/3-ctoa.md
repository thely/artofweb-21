## Four Ways: Call to Action

A call to action is exactly what it sounds like: a dominant block on the page that asks the user to do something, including donating to a nonprofit, signing up for a service, paying for a service/item, making a new account, subscribing to a newsletter, etc. You've seen dozens of these.

Write out a call to action for a nonexistent product or service, and make four different designs for it. Are you trying to get someone to download your free cookbook PDF? Do you want them to sign up for the newsletter of SEO tips? Or are you trying to entice players to spend money on a free-to-play game? Try to establish four different attitudes or expectations about the userbase, and pick fonts/images/colors to suit. I encourage you to research sites that target different populations/age ranges/styles/moods, see what they're doing, and adapt their ideas. ([Here are some examples.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/call-to-action-buttons-examples-and-best-practices/))

You are free to use as many (free) resources as you want from the internet, as long as you aren't remaking, element-for-element and style-for-style, someone else's existing call to action.

### Requirements

**Content:**  
* One common call to action for all four, written to suit a particular type of product/company. You can switch out some of the text/images if you think the writing would change depending on the audience (e.g., a cookbook for fans of drag queen vs a cookbook for new mothers in Nebraska), but the type of product/service you're selling shouldn't change.
* At least one image, which can be a foreground `image` or a CSS `background-image`.
* At least one (likely *only* one) loud, clickable button, which changes its style somewhat on `:hover`.
* Some amount of advertising copy, which is likely a short amount of text and a shorter header.

**Style:**  
* Completely different styles for all four calls
* Looks good and as intended at an average screen width (about 1024px wide)
* In addition to the positioning rules you'll already be exploring, include at least one of: box-shadow, text-shadow, transform, icon fonts (see FontAwesome, below), CSS gradients

**Reflection:**  

In your README.md, do a quick reflection. What was your product/service? What audiences were you trying to reach? Did you pick anyone to emulate? Did you discover anything interesting while putting your calls together?
