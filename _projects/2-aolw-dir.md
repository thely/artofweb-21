## Your AOLW Directory

Let's make an index page that acts as a homepage for all of your projects/assignments for this class.

Make an index.html in the base folder of your repo, and make a series of links to each project and assignment on this page. Give the links actual names, and do a short paragraph after each one so you remember what they are.

You only have 1996 and the Call to Action right now, but keep updating this page with every assignment you do.
