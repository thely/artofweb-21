## How do I know how wide my browser is?

Floats can be kind of annoying – if the browser gets too small, they'll sometimes overlap. For some of these earlier assignments that use floats, you should tell me what size your site looks best at. Here's how to figure that out.

Open the inspector, and click on this little phone/tablet icon.

This puts the browser in responsive design mode. Click and drag on the left edge of the page to change how wide it is.

This will change the width in pixels you see up at the top. Drag the page around, and see what settings make the page look its best.

And then let me know what size(s) those are! This could be "it looks best between 800px and 1000px wide," or "it starts to break at 900px wide, so make the width smaller than that," or some other variant on that.
