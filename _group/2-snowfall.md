[Snow Fall](https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/index.html#/?part=tunnel-creek)

Take a look at any of the paragraphs.

* Remind me: what is the difference between margins and padding?
* How are the margins defined? What styles are getting overridden?
* Does the padding seem like it matters here?

Look at "Saugstad was mummified."

* What's adding the camera icon?

Look at the "I Couldn't Breathe" block to the immediate right of it.

* Why is it squashing the paragraph to its left?
* Does the padding matter now? Why?
* How are the three visible elements (the image, the text, and the play button) spaced in this block? What combination of rules is spacing them?

Scroll down until you start seeing blocks in the open space on the right. "Chris Rudolph" should be the first one.

* These are placed differently in the markup. How? (Hint: Look at its parent(s).)
* How are these blocks positioned vertically?
* What's enabling the element to change when you hover over it?
* When you hover on one of the blocks, a bit of the paragraph to its left is also highlighted. What's being added to that `span` that's highlighting it?
