## Brainstorm: Interactive fiction

We'll brainstorm ideas in your groups. Do you have ideas that use the existing story prompts? Are you inspired by some of the works we looked at in class? Something completely different?

Use of an idea isn't exclusive to one group member – if all of you are inspired by one concept and want to explore it as far as you think it'll go, do it. Don't hold back on ideas, even if you think they're dumb. You don't lose anything by writing it down.
