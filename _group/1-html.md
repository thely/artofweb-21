## HTML Energy Scavenger Hunt

### Round 1: [html.energy](https://html.energy/).

#### Home page
1. How is this website structured, once you get into the `body` tag?
2. What tags do you recognize, and which ones are new? What do you think the new ones are for?
3. There's a lot of attributes (`text="some-other-text"`) in these tags. What do you think those are? When you encounter them in other tags, make note of them as well.
4. When you hover over elements in the developer tools, you see more than one color. Which colors do you see, and what do you think the colors are for?
5. Why is the little green sun spinning?

#### Podcasts
Go to the podcasts page, and then go to one of the episodes.

* How is the audio on the page? What do all the individual pieces of the tag do?
* What element(s) is/are handling the structure of the podcast episode block?

Inspect one of the "About" sections on an episode.

* What tag is responsible for the "About" header, and what tag is responsible for its revealed content?
* What's making the text on the word "About" have a different background color? How is the color defined?

Inspect one of the "Transcript" sections on an episode.

* What's the deal with the transcript body? What element is in there that you haven't seen elsewhere on this site?

### Round 2 (if you have time): [https://maxbittker.com/](https://maxbittker.com/)

* There are a *lot* of lines on this page. Where are they coming from?
* There are several links on this page, but there are other things you can interact with as well. What are they? What tags are making them?
* All of these blocks have an X next to them that you can click to close that block. Try inspecting one of them, and then click its X. What happened to make the element disappear?
* There are multiple moving elements on this page. What elements are controlling that motion?
* Try narrowing your browser window. Several things change as your window gets thinner. What's changing?
